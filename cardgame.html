                    <h1>Blackout!: The Card Game</h1>
                    <h2>RULES</h2>
                    <p>Blackout is, at its core, a simple game. 
                        Your team's objective is to get all of your players across the board to the opposing planet as quickly as possible. 
                        To do this, you roll a dice and proceed the number of spaces that the dice indicates. 
                        You then draw a card, and if you dare, respond to what is written on it. 
                        Every turn, a player will pour some of their drink into the black hole cup in the center of the board.
                        If your pour is the one that causes the drink to spill, then you must sacrifice yourself for your crew and finish the black hole. 
                        If you land on one of these spaces (image insert here) then you have gotten sucked into the black hole and must finish the drink. 
                        However, your voyage down the rabbit hole is not completely fruitless. 
                        Upon completion of the black hole cup, you may travel to the next closest wormhole to your goal planet.
                        This is a game meant to be played with friends, old and new alike. 
                        As such, among friends, a player may skip a card they do not feel comfortable to perform if they so wish by skipping their turn, and leaving their piece unmoved.
                        If any player vomits, the game is over immediately.
                        Have fun, and may the best crew win.  
                    </p>
