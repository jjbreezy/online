                    <h2>RULES</h2>
                    <p>Blackout is, at its core, a simple game. 
                        Your team's objective is to get all of your crewmates across the board to the opposing planet as quickly as possible.
                        All crewmates must land on the opposite planet in order to secure a win. No crewmate left behind.  
                        To do this, you roll a dice and proceed the number of spaces that the dice indicates. 
                        You then draw a card, and if you dare, respond to what is written on it. 
                        Every turn, a player will pour some of their drink into the black hole cup in the center of the board.
                        If your pour is the one that causes the drink to spill, then you must sacrifice yourself for your crew and finish the black hole cup. 
                        If you land on one of these spaces (image insert here) then you have gotten sucked into the black hole and must finish the drink. 
                        However, your voyage down the rabbit hole is not completely fruitless. 
                        Upon completion of the black hole cup, you may travel to the next closest wormhole to your goal planet. <!--this should have an image-->
                        This is a game meant to be played with friends, old and new alike. 
                        As such, any player may skip a card they are not comfortable with if they wish by skipping their turn, leaving their piece unmoved. 
                        (with the exception of movement cards, which are not skippable)
                        There is no limit to the number of skips a player may use, but one should keep in mind that skipping your turn puts your crew at a disadvantage.  
                        If any player vomits, the game is over immediately.
                        Have fun, and may the best crew win.  
                    </p>

                        TIMED CARDS: some cards have a time limit associated with them. This limit will be clearly displayed and count down on the dealer's phone. 
                        Failure to complete the card in the allotted time will result in the player finishing their drink.
